1. What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ?
   explain with an example.

   Ans:-
   this -
   this keyword used to call default constructor of the same class.
   The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
   The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes
   and parameters with the same name.

    *Usage of Java super Keyword
   1. this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
   2. this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
   3. this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.
   4. this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
   5.this can be passed as argument in the constructor call.
   6.this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.


 Super -
 The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.
     Whenever you create the instance of a subclass, an instance of parent class is created
     implicitly which is referred by the super reference variable.


     * Usage of Java super Keyword
 1. super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable.
 2. super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
 3. super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
