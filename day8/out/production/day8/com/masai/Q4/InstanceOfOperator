Q4. What is instance of operator explain with an example.

Ans:-

 The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).
 The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type.
  Its syntax is, objectName instanceOf className; Here, if objectName is an instance of className , the operator returns true .
  Otherwise, it returns false .
 If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.


 Ex-
    class Animal{

     public void walk(){
     System.out.println("Animal is walking");
     }
    }
    class Dog1 extends Animal{
     public void bark(){
          System.out.println("Dog  is Barking");
          }

     public static void main(String args[]){
     Dog1 d=new Dog1();
     System.out.println(d instanceof Animal);//true
     }
    }

    Ans - True
