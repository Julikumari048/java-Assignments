2. Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And
write some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.


Ans:-
 The String is immutable in Java because of the synchronization, security, caching, concurrency  and class loading.

 The difference between String and String Builder is that String is immutable and String Builder is mutable.
 An immutable object is an object whose content cannot be changed after it once created.
 The String class is in System namespace where as String Builder is in System.Text namespace.
 The string created using String class is immutable where as string created using String Builder is mutable.
 In String class Thread-Safe where as in String Builder Thread is not Safe.
 object of String is read-only in nature where as object of string Builder is dynamic in nature.


Java String Methods are :-
charAt() - Return the character at the specific index.
equals() - Compares two strings. Returns true if the strings are equal, and false if not same;
indexOf() - Returns the position of the first found occurrence of specified characters in a string;
length() - sReturns the length of a specified string;
substring() - Returns a new string which is the substring of a specified string;
